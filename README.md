# Card Component Project

Build the employee cards component you see attached to the project in the `comp.pdf` or `comp.png` PDF file.

### Things to keep in mind

    1) Should be responsive.
    2) Use semantic elements, if necessary.
    3) Don't write static CSS. Write SCSS and compile it into CSS.
